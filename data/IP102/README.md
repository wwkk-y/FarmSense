## IP102: A Large-Scale Benchmark Dataset for Insect Pest Recognition

This [work](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Wu_IP102_A_Large-Scale_Benchmark_Dataset_for_Insect_Pest_Recognition_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf) was accepted by CVPR 2019.

The IP102 datset contains more than 75,000 images belongs to 102 categories. A natural long-tailed distribution presents on it. In addition, we annotate 19,000 images with bounding boxes for object detection. The IP102 has a hierarchical taxonomy and the insect pests which mainly affect one specific agricultural product are grouped into the same upper-level category.
